#
#  Description:  Registers the core 'phb_test' component.
#
#  Note:         Due to problems encountered with the ESPHome local component
#                registration method, the class was implemented as a singleton.
#                When the underlying issues are resolved, this component will be
#                integrated with ESPhome via the prescribed registration
#                method.
